## Import

Data had to be imported. The original xlsx was improved: two items (Person2 - Pompfe; 103 - best number of stones) were seperated into item groups, since multiple selections were effectively possible and encuraged by the questions. The file was exported into a csv for import into R (note: i know of the package 'xlsx', but it often does not what i want to do, while the other way through a csv has been profen to be rock solid)

```{r import}
Testergebnis.Fragebogen <- read.delim2("~/ownCloud/Programming/jugger_data/chain2016/Testergebnis Fragebogen.csv", quote="'")
```
